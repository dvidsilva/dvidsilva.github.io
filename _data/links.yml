    author: Caveat Magister
    description: >
      Over 30 years, San Francisco's underground art scene developed techniques to create magical, impossible, life-changing experiences. Today big corporations are trying to figure out how to spend millions of dollars to do what these artists and anti-artists did using nothing but time, space, and imagination. It was "a movement without a manifesto," with people discovering how it worked through trial and error. Very little was written down - until now. Caveat Magister, widely seen as one of the leading voices of Burning Man's philosophy, has written this book to explain what these experiences were, why they worked, and how you can create your own.
