Dec 3 2022 we hosted an event at the Copacabana in Manhattan to launch a new art collective.

**[Santo Cabron](https://instagram.com/santo_cabron) presents el Baile de los ke Sobran**

We invited a variety of artists to present their art and were blown away by the submissions and absolutely impressed by the curation and presentation from [Sofia](https://www.instagram.com/sofiamonzerratt/) and her team.

The venue loved the event, and we'll be there, stay tuned for upcoming dates, and our schedule for LoveBurn 2023.
