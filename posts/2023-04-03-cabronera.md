# Cabronera

Desigining a stage structure that packs well and can be transported, build and break down easily for multiple burning man events around the country. 

The design builds on years of experience of structures in the desert, and other high risk regions. It uses lightweight material, easy to acquire and replace, easy to prepackage and install. 


**Introduction**

Cabroneras are an ancient form of sacred comunal structure from the andean indigenous peoples. Also known by other names like Maloka, chozaâ€™eguadua, mariconada, playa labs shade structure, kfar hanokdim.


Crossing the portal we summon will remind you of those long story nights in the desert near Jerusalem, where the bedouins share their stash with lucky wanderers
