**Happy holidays 2022! Now that many are planning their upcoming year, coming up with goals and plans to achieve them, I wanted to share some of my easiest productivity tips.**

I often get asked about my time management, any particular week I'm simultaneously working on an arts collective, producing events, managing a community, coding, managing coders, cooking, taekwondo, rabbinical school, etc. Not in an uniquely busy manner, more like humanely impossible when considering the bounds of reality.

Twenty twenty two alone I was a part time freelance web developer, co-producer and emotional safety lead in nyc nightlife and burning man events, got promoted three times on taekwondo, traveled, started a new job as CTO, got engaged, moved in with my fianc√©, podcasts, fundraisers, conferences, etc. Not to brag or whatever, because I don't care, but to help you consider the possibilities. Also, FYI, real humbleness is about truth, not diminishing yourself.[*](https://torah.org/learning/mlife-ch2law3b/)

For 2023 the list is even longer and more ambitious, and some of the people involved wanted me to write this down, and here we are. I hope this short read can inspire you and give you some ideas that you can easily put into practice at your own convenience, or share it mockingly, it helps us either way.

**Decisions that affect everyone were made by a few who are harming the world. Is good to stop and reconsider, why is it that I'm doing this? change our course towards community and compassion. Once enough of us have done it, the world will feel saved.**

## Bulletpoints

### Calmness & Mental health

This should always be your top priority, managing to stay collected in any situation, and furthermore learning to rest and appreciate calmness will be super important to be able to do anything else. However, I don't like most commercially available approaches to mental health and the tools they provide, anecdata shows that approaches like:
 [CPTSD](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-complex-ptsd-workbook-a-mind-body-approach-to-regaining-emotional-control-and-becoming-whole-arielle-schwartz/9556452?ean=9781623158248),
[IFS](https://bookshop.org/p/books/internal-family-systems-skills-training-manual-trauma-informed-treatment-for-anxiety-depression-ptsd-substance-abuse-martha-sweezy/9850865?ean=9781683730873),
[Logotherapy](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-will-to-meaning-foundations-and-applications-of-logotherapy-viktor-e-frankl/11653436?ean=9780142181263), and
[Psychomagic](https://bookshop.org/p/books/manual-of-psychomagic-the-practice-of-shamanic-psychotherapy-alejandro-jodorowsky/7178851?ean=9781620551073)
are far more effective at dealing with different mental conditions caused by the alienation of modern society.

Additionally, not only you have to deal with yourself, in order to effectively apply the discipline that you need for super productivity, you need to care about the emotional stability of people around you, I recommend familiarizing yourself with concepts like those as much as possible, and sharing with the people around you to send them on a path that will give you more calm time for yourself.

Achieving a clear state of mind where you understand very well what causes your behavior is super important to later on be able to design change strategies that will get you closer to your goals.

Whenever you feel anxious or distraught, is very important to deal with that first before anything else. A task is performed much faster after pausing to take care of yourself than pushing yourself thru it; some people don't notice it because their baseline is wack due to the accumulation of stress.

**There's no data here to persuade you, just try it for a few days and do the math.**

### Physical health

community and friends super important, yes and
