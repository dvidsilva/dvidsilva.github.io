**Happy holidays 2022! Now that many are planning their upcoming year, coming up with goals and plans to achieve them, I wanted to share some of my easiest productivity tips.**

I often get asked about my time management, any particular week I'm simultaneously working on an arts collective, producing events, managing a community, coding, managing coders, cooking, taekwondo, rabbinical school, etc. Not in an uniquely busy manner, more like humanely impossible when considering the bounds of reality. quality bla bla

came up with them as a kid, and improved upon them in art school, rabbinical school, coaching and engineering school -

tips:

emotionaal regulation top priority

physical health super imporotant, active, diet that is like fine

community and friends super important, yes and

harm reduction

discipline, develop your own system
