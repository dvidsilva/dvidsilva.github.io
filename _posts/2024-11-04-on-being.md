## We do this not because is easy, but because we thought it would be easy

When I share with someone that I'm undocumented or illegal, I love when their response is “Hell yeah!”.  Is important to embrace reality with pride, humor, and berraquera. I'm lucky to have partners, customers, friends, and collaborators that make it seem like I'm just like any one of them.

I’m not a unique case. Many refugees and undocumented people landed comfortably on a plane, student or work visa, and, for one reason or another, entered a state of limbo—overstaying, missing deadlines, and navigating confusing bureaucratic steps. I chose to come in an  challenging way, it has shown me parts of society easily ignored.

La vida no es solo blanco y negro; is messy and radically contradictory, absurd. I grew up in a city dedicated to nature, art, music, and community, shadowed by narcos, sicarios y corrupción. The same person and place in my memories can be a contradictory source of joy and pain. My parents always emphasized the importance of threating everyone with respect, and building community - and here in the US I've found a home in the resilience of others, joining in a variety of places from undocumented high school students to puerto rico after a hurricane.

Mis compitas, gonorreitas, the ones who’ll drop everything to show up, who’ll share the little they have, are usually other immigrants, sharing our recipes and stories from lovely places abroad. Our challenges can't shrink our dreams. *pa'atras ni pa coger impulso*.

There's another election in the US tomorrow, we survived 3 national presidential campaigns being called criminals and garbage.

 Whoever ends up winning doesn’t change the reality for millions of us. It won't automatically make it easier for my friends in Colombian having their appointments postponed by months. Real change will come by participating in our local communities, and joining forces to find solutions to systemic problems.

Our cells evolve through biological exchange, and our societies evolve through cultural and intellectual exchange. Así es como crecemos, como artistas, ingenieros, filósofos. The French helped us break from Spain and brought us *le droit politique*, American movies fuel our cineastas, and Nueva York nos dio un lienzo donde dibujamos la salsa.

Be one of those people who leans into abundance, opens your life to others. Call things by their name, not to settle but to inspire action. Find ways to improve something for your family and friends. Political parties won’t even matter. We’re creating something better, algo que vale la pena.
