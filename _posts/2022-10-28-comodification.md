**Talking about money on the community seems to be uncomfortable and leaves many vulnerable members at risk** on situations that could easily be solved by lending a hand, oferring a job, groceries or whatever, stop being so coy with money and figure it out before you keep losing people to homenelessness, suicide and other easily preventable problems.

I was gonna write a whole thing, but if you need more info google it or something, tired of doing everything for you all the time.
